Inspired from the Norse mythology, [Heimdallr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimdallr), modernly anglicized as Heimdall is the gatekeeper of Bifr√∂st, the rainbow road connecting Midgard, realm of the humans, to
Asgard, the realm of Gods.

In **CodeIgniter 4**, Heimdall serves as the gatekeeper between the client and resource server. Heimdall gives you an out of the box OAuth 2 authorization protocol implementation to your CodeIgniter's Web Service. Heimdall also comes with some handy extensions such as [Open ID Connect](https://heimdall.ezralazuardy.com/documentation/oidc) support to gives you a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2 protocol and a [Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://heimdall.ezralazuardy.com/documentation/pkce) support.

Heimdall implements the standards compliant implementation of an [OAuth 2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) authorization server written in PHP which makes working with OAuth 2 trivial. You can easily configure an OAuth 2 server to protect your API with access tokens, or allow clients to request new access tokens and refresh them.

This library was created in order to simplify the need of OAuth 2 implementation in your CodeIgniter 4 framework, based on the [OAuth 2.0 Server](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server) library by [thephpleague](https://thephpleague.com/).
